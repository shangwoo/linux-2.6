* Alphascale ASM9260 SoC pinctrl core driver

The pinctrl driver enables Alphascale ASM9260 to configure the multi-purpose pins
(MPP) to a specific function.

Required properties for pinctrl driver:
- compatible: "alphascale,asm9260-pinctrl"
- reg: Register base of the MPP block and length.
- clocks: clock ids.
- clock-names:
	* 1 "ahb" : AHB gating clock.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

The pin configuration nodes act as a container for an arbitrary number of
subnodes. Each of these subnodes represents some desired configuration for a
pin or a list of pins. This configuration can include the
mux function to select on those pin(s), and various pin configuration
parameters, as listed below.

SUBNODES:

The name of each subnode is not important; all subnodes should be enumerated
and processed purely based on their content.

Each subnode only affects those parameters that are explicitly listed. In
other words, a subnode that lists a mux function but no pin configuration
parameters implies no information about any pin configuration parameters.
Similarly, a pin subnode that describes a pullup parameter implies no
information about e.g. the mux function.

The following generic properties as defined in pinctrl-bindings.txt are valid
to specify in a pin configuration subnode:
pins			- the list of pins that properties in the node
			  apply to (either this or "group" has to be
			  specified)
function		- the mux function to select
bias-disable		- disable any pin bias
bias-pull-up		- pull up the pin. Supported only on GPIO0_* pins.
bias-pull-down		- pull down the pin. Supported on all pins except of GPIO0_*.

Examples:

pinctrl: pinctrl@80044000 {
	compatible = "alphascale,asm9260-pinctrl";
	reg = <0x80044000 0x400>;
	clocks = <&acc CLKID_AHB_IOCONFIG>;
	clock-names = "ahb";
